<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Developed a multiple-screen mobile application for WGU students to track their academic terms, courses associated with each term, and assessments associated with each course. The application will allows students to enter, edit, and delete terms, courses, and assessment data. It provides summary and detailed views of courses for each term, provides notifications for upcoming performance and objective assessments, and notifies students of deadlines and tracking milestones even after the application is closed. The application utilizes a SQLite database to store user information.

### Built With
* [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet)
* [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor)
